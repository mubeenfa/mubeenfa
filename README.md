👋 Hi, I’m Mubeen

I’m a Software Engineer with experience building production-grade systems across Applied AI & automation, cross-platform software, and game / simulation & XR.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering execution and product thinking—designing systems that are practical, scalable, and aligned with real-world user and business constraints.

I’ve contributed to enterprise training platforms, simulation systems, analytics tools, and AI-powered applications, collaborating with cross-functional teams in international, English-speaking environments.

🧩 Areas of Focus

🛠️ Software Engineering & Systems

I build systems that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and long-term evolution.

Modular application & system architecture API design, backend integration & data workflows

Cross-platform development (Web, Mobile, Desktop, XR)

Performance optimization & deployment-aware engineering Agile/Scrum practices, documentation, code reviews & mentoring

🧠 Applied AI & Automation

I focus on applying AI within real software systems, not isolated research.

NLP pipelines & semantic similarity systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows Embeddings & vector search (FAISS)

LLM integration, prompt design & response evaluation

AI-driven automation & workflow tooling Emphasis on reproducibility, evaluation, and usability.

🎮 Game, Simulation & XR Systems

My background in game development and XR shapes how I think about interaction, performance, and real-time systems.

Unity-based simulation & training platforms WebGL / WebXR / VR application development Data-driven scenes & real-time interaction systems

Enterprise and educational simulation architecture

Bridging creative pipelines with engineering constraints

🔍 How I Work

Start with clear problem framing before implementation

Make deliberate technical trade-offs under real constraints

Product-aware engineering: delivery, usability, and impact matter

Document decisions to keep systems understandable over time

Curious, adaptable, and collaborative by default

📌 Selected Work

This profile includes projects covering: End-to-end AI/NLP systems and RAG pipelines

Applied AI demos integrated into usable applications

Cross-platform software & simulation systems

Experiments exploring architecture, tooling, and automation

Each project emphasizes intent, design decisions, and limitations—not just code.
